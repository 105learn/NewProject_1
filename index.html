<h1>HELLO EVERYBODY</h1>
<p style="color:yellow">The golden temple of Amritsar comes back to me like a dream.
 Many a morning have I accompanied my father to this Gurudarbar of the Sikhs 
 in the middle of the lake. There the sacred chanting resounds continually.</p>
 
 <blockquote><p>My father, seated amidst the throng of worshippers, would sometimes add his
 voice to the hymn of praise, and finding a stranger joining in their devotions 
 they would wax enthusiastically cordial, and we would return loaded with the 
 sanctified offerings of sugar crystals and other sweets.</p></blockquote><br>
